OK great job so far now let's move to the second phase of giving this beast a proper structure based on the business reality-based on how I have envisioned erp should be.
 to be honest not only for phtrading but an ideal eRP should be something that isn't currently there in the market. the few things that we make us reach where I want this to reach is as follows;
 the landing page: ph trading WLL needs to havea  login section with username and password.  everybody will put their email ID as their username and password  
This means we need to have a basic use, a management system for an admin. Admin can create users or delete users or manage users . Use a creation needs to come with a mandatory drop down. Where user type needs to be defined. Based on this defined user type, the options that are available for each user will differ from account to account. For now, I can think of four different type of users. 
1. Master user or admin
2. Manager
3. Accounts 
4. Regular user
Master user or Admin will be used by me as the owner of the company. I should have complete comprehensive reforms of everything. All the dashboards that are currently there, which i'm seeing, should be visible to me
Second is manager, view, hear the left left hand side panel needs to have
All the options that are currently there.
But it does not need cash flow visibility from customers. It does not need to have user management Admin. Related options it can have business intelligence competition analysis. And everything else that a regular user has
Plus it needs to have a view of every regular user's activity, including his own within it which includes logistic status of orders, heatmap everything related to sales
Third one will be the accountant's view. The finances you were, the accountant needs to know the cash flow currency conversion.
Logistics status of orders etc
Last but not the list for our remaining team they need to see their own hit map. Their own RF q's assign to them, obviously by themselves. I don't want an unnecessarily case creation, ticket creation, and all that jazz. I want it to be very straightforward. You go to the quick view, and you create your own opportunities. Anew basically give visibility to your manager, and that way he is gazing, you get grading, you everything Kra's n kpi's can be set basis this 
Everything related to this month's target this quarterus, target, etc, needs to be defined. There by the manager
Search bases, the user management  n views that every user will get
If I look at the quick capture, follow-up today schedule RF management quotation management, it looks a little bit a out of sync. I wanted to be in a certain flow. The layout I mean
The cycle needs to start at creating
An opportunity which basically can be an r f q or a lead that is generated by the user individually this will be treated as the RFQ. Based on this RF QA quotation needs to be prepared for a quotation preparation. There is an costing sheet which is available on OneDrive for you to refer. I want that costing to be made available on the year p itself, wherein I can just input the product description. Name quantity and based on current converse, currency conversion rates that you already know. On the prerequisites of margins and markups that I have, which can be added, which are static. The costing needs to be prepared an excel or xml. Whatever format can be made downloadable, so that a copy of it can be saved as a revision, one revision, 2, revision, 3, etc. Etera, on OneDrive. Manually by the user, once this costing is finalised, then a finalised costing button can be made available based on which a quotation will be prepared. We need to also make sure the current format of quotations which are being used kept constant across. So everybody uses the same format in the same layout with the company logo and water mark header footer  etc
This PDF can then be sent as an email.
Since we already have customer database, it would be great if we could add customer details from the customer database. Another static information like contact person, phone number, etc. Terms & Conditions delivery timelines, all those things that go with an offer offer validity date. Etc. needs to be like a choice of options when the quotation is being created
Once the quote is generated, it can be assumed that it is submitted to the customer on the same date. Because it will be sent through outlook
Then starts the followup loop basis This submission date
If there is a customer confirmation, it will be a l o i or a letter of intent. The date will be manually captured, and it will be considered as successfully won.
Now this starts another chain of events where we are placing the order of the intended goods to the manufacturer here.That needs to be captured.Whether the order is placed or no
If the order is placed, then the delivery timeline can be followed up
What we do usually is we combine multiple orders and take one singular shipment. So we know that delivery dates will coincide for multiple orders that will become one consignment based on the similarity of the delivery date
We should be able to track in each delivery. Which all opportunities are being catered to with all customers r gonna get there items based on each shipment
There needs to be 2 statuses customs cleared and items delivered once items are delivered. Then the payment schedule can start. We usually have 30 day payment schedule. So if item was delivered on the first of january on thirtieth of january, the reminder should be open up for payments
All in all the flow should be
capture request or rfq then costing then quotation then delivery then payment
That's quite a bit apart from this, but this is at the heart of it all. So once we have set this much up, I will give you more on the other aspects of every business.So that we have a robust, all rounded system
